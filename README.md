# 🤖 RollerBoi – Feedback & Issue Tracker
(This entire ReadMe file was made with AI, but I wanted to open a way for feedback without sacrificing coding time, sorry! // Jelly)

Welcome to the official public feedback repository for **RollerBoi**.

This repository exists so the community can:

- 🐛 Report bugs  
- 💡 Suggest new features  
- 🛠 Improve existing features  
- ❓ Ask technical questions  
- 📖 Suggest documentation improvements  

If you’ve never used GitHub before, don’t worry — this guide walks you through everything step by step.

## 📌 Before You Submit Anything

Please take 30 seconds to:

1. Click on the **Issues** tab at the top of this page.
2. Use the search bar to check if someone already reported the same thing.
3. If you find a similar issue:
   - 👍 React with a thumbs up instead of creating a new one.
   - Add helpful extra information in a comment if needed.

This helps us keep things clean and organized.

## 🐛 How To Report A Bug

A bug is when something:
- Does not work
- Crashes
- Responds incorrectly
- Behaves differently than expected

### Step-by-step

1. Click the **Issues** tab.
2. Click the green **New Issue** button.
3. Select **Bug report** (or create a blank issue if templates are not enabled).
4. Fill in:

   - **What happened?**
   - **What did you expect to happen?**
   - **Steps to reproduce it**
   - Screenshots (if possible)
   - The command you used (if relevant)

### Good example
Command: /start
Expected: Game should begin

The more details you give, the faster we can fix it.

## 🏷 About Labels (What They Mean)

You don’t need to worry too much about labels — maintainers usually assign them.

But here’s what they mean:

- **bug** → Something is broken  
- **enhancement** → Improvement to existing feature  
- **documentation** → Docs update  
- **question** → Clarification needed  
- **duplicate** → Already reported  
- **invalid** → Not a bug / incorrect usage  
- **wontfix** → Will not be implemented  
- **good first issue** → Good for new contributors  
- **help wanted** → Community contributions welcome  

---

## 🔒 Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a vulnerability or something that could be abused:

**Do NOT post it publicly.**

Instead, contact the maintainers directly via Discord or email.  
(Add contact info here.)

Security comes first.

## ⏳ What Happens After You Submit?

1. A maintainer reviews your issue.
2. It gets labeled and prioritized.
3. It may be:
   - Scheduled
   - Discussed further
   - Marked duplicate
   - Closed with explanation

Not all suggestions will be implemented, but all constructive feedback is appreciated.
